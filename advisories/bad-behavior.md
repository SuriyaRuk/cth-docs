# Bad behavior

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you try to cheat the system or act contrary to the specification, you will be liable to incur a penalty known as **slashing**. Running your validator keys simultaneously on two or more machines will result in slashing.
{% endhint %}

_Simply being offline with an otherwise healthy network does not result in slashing, but will result in small inactivity penalties._

* [x] I understand that if I act contrary to the specification, I am liable to be slashed.
