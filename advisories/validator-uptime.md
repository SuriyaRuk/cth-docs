# Validator uptime

{% hint style="warning" %}
You'll only get your full rewards if your validator is online and up to date. This is your responsibility. If your validator goes offline you'll be penalized. The penalties for being offline are roughly equal to the rewards for actively participating.
{% endhint %}

* [x] I understand that it is important to keep my validator online and updated.
