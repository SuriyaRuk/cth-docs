# The Deposit

To become a validator on the Beacon Chain, you must deposit 32 CTH for each validator you wish to run.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deposits are non-reversible. Once you deposit CTH onto the Beacon Chain, that deposit cannot be reversed.\
The ability to withdraw your deposited CTH later is handled via a separate withdrawal process that remains under your control.
{% endhint %}

* [x] I understand that I need to deposit 32 CTH onto the Beacon Chain to become a validator. Withdrawing deposited CTH from the Beacon Chain is accomplished via a separate process
