# Proof of stake

CTH Blockchain uses proof-of-stake to reach a consensus. For this, we need active participants—known as validators—to propose, verify, and vouch for the validity of blocks. In exchange, honest validators receive financial rewards. Importantly, as a validator you'll need to post CTH as collateral—in other words, have some funds at stake. The only way to become a validator is to make a one-way CTH transaction to the deposit contract on the Mainnet execution layer. The Beacon Chain (consensus layer) is used in parallel to keep track of all validator activity.
