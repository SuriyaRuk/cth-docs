# Key management

To become a validator you'll need to know about managing keys and protecting a mnemonic. If you are not yet familiar with keys and mnemonics, please do not proceed.

We'll help you create a signing key for every validator you want to run. You may choose to provide a withdrawal address for your validator when generating your deposit data, which will permanently set the withdrawal address. This is recommended for most users.

If you do not provide a withdrawal address with your initial deposit data, you will need to derive your withdrawal keys from your mnemonic at a later time, so store your mnemonic safely — it will be the ONLY way to withdraw your CTH when you choose to activate withdrawals.



* [x] I understand that keys are my responsibility and that my mnemonic (seed) will be the **ONLY WAY** to withdraw my funds if I don't provide a withdrawal address with initial deposit data.
